#Lets try to make a simple calculator where we edit the values in the code itself 

num1 = 4
num2 = 95
#num3 if you want 

print (num1*num2) # add the variable name in the bracket for which you wanna perform the mathematical operation
                 # + for add 
                   # - for sub
                   # * for multiplication
                   # / for divide 
                   # % for remainder
